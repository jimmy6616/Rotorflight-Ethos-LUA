# Ethos LUA Suite Guide operating with Rotorflight Configurator

## Introduction
You can adjust a variety of settings using only your transmitter with the Rotorflight Lua scripts. They allow you to change things like PIDs, rates, filters, failsafe and governed headspeed at the field. 

Pre-requisites:

- Ethos 1.5 or newer on the transmitter and

- an FrSky SmartPort or F.Port receiver.

- or a CRSF v2.11 or newer receiver.

- or an ELRS 2.0.1 or newer receiver.


Examples:

- Frsky Tandem X20S with an Archer receiver and F.port protocols.
- Frsky Ethos Radio (X18, X14 etc) with either SPORT,FPORT receiver or ELRS with an external module.


If you're using F.Port, start up the Rotorflight Configurator, go to the Configuration tab and enable the TELEMETRY feature. F.Port telemetry does not work without enabling this feature.

If telemetry is working properly on your system, the Lua scripts should also work.

# Installation
Download the RFSuite [latest release](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases) Unzip and copy the contents to the SCRIPTS folder to your transmitter.
